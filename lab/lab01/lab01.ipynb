A notebook is a place to host share explanatory content intended for humans usually in association with computational programs and their results. This notebook format supports reproducible computational research where anyone with access to the notebook and the relevant data will more than likely be able to reproduce the work done by the original researchers. Reproducibility is part of the backbone of modern scientific research. Notebook files on a computer end in `.ipynb`. This file extension is a reference to the IPython programming environment developed by [Fernando P√©rez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_P%C3%A9rez_(software_developer)).
