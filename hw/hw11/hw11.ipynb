    "Having read section [16.3](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/16/3/Prediction_Intervals.html) of the textbook, you know just the response! Had the sample been different, the regression line would have been different too. This would ultimately result in a different prediction. To see how good our prediction is, we must get a sense of how variable the prediction can be."
