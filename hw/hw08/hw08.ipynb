    "3. Double-check your responses to the manually graded tasks marked with üìçüîé.\n",
    "3. Select the menu item \"File\" and \"Save Notebook\" in the notebook's Toolbar to save your work and create a specific checkpoint in the notebook's work history.\n",
    "4. Select the menu items \"File\", \"Download\" in the notebook's Toolbar to download the notebook (.ipynb) file. \n",
